Scripture Engagement Application: Server

== Create a Database

Create a Postgres database:

* Database name: `galilee`
* User: `galilee`
* Password: `pass`

If these values are not to your liking,
update the contents of `knexfile.js`
to correspond to your preferences.

== Create the Schema

From the command line, run:

   npm run knex:migrate

This should create all the database tables
in the current version of the software.

== Load Fixture Data

From the command line, run:

   npm run knex:seed

This should add sample data to the database.

== Run the Server

Run the `start` command from `package.json`:

   npm start

You can also run the `nodemon` server,
which will restart the server when any source file changes:

   npm run watch

== Run Tests

Run the complete test suite:

   npm test

Run the suite with coverage output
(currently to `foo-coverage.html`):

   npm run test-cov
