{ "title": "Public Reading of Scripture", "id": 9 }

The Bible was meant to be read, but it was also meant to be heard. To hear
someone read the Word is a different experience than to simply read silently to
oneself. A well-prepared and gifted reader can bring out meaning in a text
through voice inflection, rhythm, and intonation. A talented reader can present
the Word of God to a group or congregation so that the listeners may experience
the Bible in a rich and powerful manner. Suggestions for reading the selected
passage out loud (either by yourself or with other people) will be given in
this section.
