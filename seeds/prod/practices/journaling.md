# Journaling Scripture

A Scripture journal is a conversation with God.
It is meant to be a place where we can safely record and reflect
on our raw thoughts and feelings, ask questions, search for patterns,
and develop our own thoughts with the Holy Spirit as our guide.
Being candid with both God and ourselves deeply enhances spiritual growth.
Confession to God results in an open and honest relationship with God
which allows the Spirit to continue to shape and mold us into Christ’s image.

How do we journal Scripture?
After reading a passage of Scripture,
basic Scripture journaling could include the following steps:

- writing out verses that stood out to you
- jotting down questions about the passage
- writing down a truth from the passage
- writing down action steps for yourself based on your reading
- writing a praise to God for a promise that was meaningful to you
- writing out prayers for yourself or others that were prompted by the passage
- writing out a confession because you’ve fallen short of an action in the passage
- asking God for help in living out a passage
