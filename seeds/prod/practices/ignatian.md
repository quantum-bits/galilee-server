# The Ignatian Method

The Ignatian method of Scripture engagement gives us the opportunity to engage
our imaginations by placing ourselves in the stories of Scripture in an attempt
to better empathize with the people of the Bible and understand the stories in
a more experiential way. The idea is to place yourself in the biblical story,
becoming a person in the crowd, a disciple or the boy with the loaves and
fish. Imagine the sights, sounds, smells, feels, and tastes of this ancient
world. You step into the story and let it enter your mind, not just a series of
facts, but as a story with actual characters who felt and experienced
life. This method is especially helpful for those who tend to connect to
Scripture on a purely cognitive level. It involves our emotions, enveloping our
whole person. With the Ignatian method, you are no longer just reading a book,
you are living a story. God has given us the biblical stories so we can connect
with them on all levels so we can know who he is and what he cares about.
