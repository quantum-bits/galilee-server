{ "title": "Memorizing Scripture" }

Memorizing Scripture is one of the most effective means of Scripture
engagement. Because Scripture engagement is about reflecting on the Bible and
mulling a passage over in our minds, having a passage memorized makes the
process of reflection available to us at all times. Memorized Scripture allows
us to dwell continuously on a passage throughout the day. Suggestions for what
to memorize and how will be given in this section.
