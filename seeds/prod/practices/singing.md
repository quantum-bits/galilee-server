# Singing Scripture

Singing the truths in the Bible enhances our experience with God through his
Word both emotionally and cognitively. Excellent music stirs our hearts,
enhancing the feelings that are associated with the message of the lyrics. The
lyrics of songs are poetry. Poetry, because of its extensive imagery, also
helps us feel the truth of a message in a powerful way. Singing Scriptures can
deepen our thinking about God by helping us meditate on God’s truth. The more
often we sing/pray a passage, the more we understand the passage and are
changed by that understanding of God’s Word. The psalms/songs of the Bible are
words spoken to God or about God. They help us to express ourselves honestly
to God. The power of song to help us remember is irrefutable. Having
Scripture memorized in song form both helps in the memorizing process and, if
the tune is well done, enhances the emotions of the passage as well.
