{ "title": "Manuscripting Bible Study" }

The Manuscripting Bible Study practice starts with the
"marking" of a passage in a small group setting.
People gather together to observe a passage
where they see more details as a community
than they would as individuals.
Individuals first mark (circle, underline, highlight, etc.)
their manuscript, looking for key words, promises,
contrasts/comparisons, illustrations, repetition of ideas,
structure of the passage, connections, etc.
They also develop questions they have about the passage.
The group then shares their observations and questions
and works together to answer those questions from the Bible.
The group then processes and applies the passage together.
