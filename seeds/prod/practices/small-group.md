{ "title": "Small Group" }

As members of the Body of Christ, our spiritual growth is dependent on
connecting with other parts of the Body – there should be no "solo"
Christians. Engaging with Scripture with other believers is a key way to grow
in our relationship with Christ. Small groups are one important means of
engaging Scripture communally. Getting together in a small group reflects the
discipleship methods Jesus used to lead his disciples. It also provides
accountability between members in a direct and meaningful way, and ministries
can employ small groups in such a way that all members are connected and cared
for individually. Small groups are a wonderful way to teach people, by example,
how to engage with Scripture. In regards to Scripture engagement practices, a
few methods (e.g., storying, manuscript Bible study, and dramatizing), are
naturally done in a small group setting. Other Scripture engagement practices,
commonly done by individuals, can be retooled for small groups (e.g.,
handcopying, journaling, praying, memorizing). This section will suggest
specific suggestions on the passages for the day you could use in a small group
setting.
